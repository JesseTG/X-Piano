X Piano
=======

A Web piano is all fine and good.  A Goat Piano?  Even better.  But what if you could have a piano that played *any sound you wanted?*

To select your own sound to play, upload a file towards the right of the control panel.  Pick any valid audio file.  Then go nuts!

Tested on Chromium 37 and Firefox 33, on Ubuntu 14.04.  Your mileage will vary.  Will not work on any version of Internet Explorer.

Documentation for the filters is forthcoming.

The default sound is a square wave created in [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).
